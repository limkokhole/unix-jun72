This directory contains files used to populate the root and usr 
filesystems.

Historic binaries
These binaries are from the "1972_stuff" folder in the TUHS archive.

  root - files from s2.tar.gz, excluding the usr directory, used
         to populate the rf0 filesystem.
  usr  - files from s2.tar.gz under the usr directory, used to populate
         the rk0 filesystem.


Newly built binaries
These binaries were built recently while reconstructing the system:

  new/etc/init - built from jun72 printout sources for init.s
                 with modifications to spawn getty on tty8 (console) only.
