    - get sh.s building and tested
    - integrate building init.s and sh.s into the build process
    - consider writing a mount.s?
    - can we get fpsym?  What would its function be?
    - push ke changes to simh back into mainline tree.
    - get dc-11 support into simh.  started but lots to be done
    - we should investigate the original boot process and see how
      much of it would be possible to restore and determine if its
      worth the effort.
      - I think James Markevitch might have some of this done already.
    - there's a bunch of file fragments in the 1972_stuff that might
      prove useful.  It sounds like Warren has started to think about
      how to triage these.  This might be a bit of effort.
    - at some point we should probably put together some kind of package
      for others who want to run the system in simh.  I'm not really
      sure what this should look like and perhaps its a bit early to talk
      about it...  Maybe two sets - a set of rf0 and rk0 images with
      a kernel that can run instantly, and a set with a cold kernel,
      a normal kernel and a tape image?
      - the current tree is a lot cleaner and a long ways towards this.

Done
    - 0407 binaries supported through a patch.
    - old init lives.  not yet integrated into normal build process.
    - got Early_C_Compiler working with some kernel patches to support
      larger core size and 0407 binaries
